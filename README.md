# Video Resizer

## Summary:

A simple script that utilises the `python-ffmpeg` library and allows you to compress videos (MP4) by resizing their resolution. It will resize all of the videos in the `vids_to_resize` folder and save the resized video in the `resized_videos` folder.

## How to Use:

Adjust the desired size in the "size" paramater of the "resize_video" function
